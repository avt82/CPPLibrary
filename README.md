# CPPLibrary
I am an embedded developer, coding in C (sometimes Assembly language, sometimes C++ embedded).

Sometimes I have to write CLI (command-line interface) tools to interact or test in one or another way with the devices I am working on. These tools I am writing on C++ (however I am not C++ developer, and I am not that proficient in OOP and modern C++), but there are a lot of similarities in all the ranges of these tools.
I feel sick'n'tired of doing the very same thing over and over again, so here are open-source C++ libraries for the things I am dealing really often.

All these libraries are written for my own usage, there are a lot of conceptual issues, there is a lack of OOP knowledge, it is not based on high performance or extreme low memory consumption, as far as I am doing it for my own CLI tools - it is perfectly fine with me.
If someone will find it useful - you are very welcome to use it for your own products, except of claiming the copyright for the original code, re-sale or provide it as his own code.
However, any software written by third-party with help of my libraries could be used however the developer will decide.

I am keeping my right to make the repositories private, sell it, change it (including the interfaces, class names, namespaces, etc.), change the license or any other action on my desite, without infoerming the users or the followers.
